‚ö° Compute as a Service on AWS
What is Compute?
Compute means the processing power needed to run applications‚Äîlike web servers, databases, or machine learning.
Traditionally, companies had to buy, install, and manage their own physical servers (which is slow, expensive, and hard to scale).
How AWS Makes Compute Easy
AWS already owns and manages the servers and data centers.
You can quickly ‚Äúrent‚Äù the computing power you need, when you need it.
No waiting for hardware, no big upfront costs, and you can scale up or down anytime.
