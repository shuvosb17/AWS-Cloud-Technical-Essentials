# 🚀 Introduction to Week 2: Compute and Networking on AWS

## What’s Next?

- You’ve learned AWS basics, global infrastructure, and how to set up your account.
- Last lesson: You launched an **EC2 instance** (a virtual server) to run your app.

---

## What is Compute?

- **Compute** = The power (CPU, memory, networking) needed to run your app.
- **EC2** is one way to get compute on AWS, but there are others:
    - **ECS/EKS:** Run containers (small, portable app packages)
    - **Lambda:** Run code without managing servers (serverless)

---

## Where Do EC2 Instances Live?

- Every EC2 instance must be inside a **network**.
- On AWS, this network is called a **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**.
- You’ll learn how to set up and use VPCs for your apps.

## 🐱 Real-World Example

Think of EC2 as renting a computer, and VPC as the private office where you keep it safe and connected.

---

**In summary:**

You’ll explore different AWS compute options (EC2, containers, serverless) and learn how to connect them using VPCs. Keep an eye on the readings for extra tips and details!


# ⚡ Compute as a Service on AWS

## What is Compute?

- **Compute** means the processing power needed to run applications—like web servers, databases, or machine learning.
- Traditionally, companies had to buy, install, and manage their own physical servers (which is slow, expensive, and hard to scale).

---

## How AWS Makes Compute Easy

- **AWS already owns and manages the servers and data centers.**
- You can quickly “rent” the computing power you need, when you need it.
- No waiting for hardware, no big upfront costs, and you can scale up or down anytime.

---

## Main Compute Options on AWS

| Service | What It Is | Example Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **EC2** | Virtual machines (like renting a PC) | Hosting a website or database |
| **Containers** | Lightweight, portable app packages | Microservices, DevOps pipelines |
| **Serverless** | Run code without managing servers | Event-driven apps, automation |

---

## 🖼️ Diagram: Compute as a Service

## 🐱 Real-World Example

Imagine you want to open a bakery:

- **Old way:** Buy the building, ovens, and equipment yourself (takes months, costs a lot).
- **AWS way:** Rent a fully-equipped kitchen by the hour—just show up and start baking!

---

**In summary:**

AWS Compute as a Service lets you run your apps without the hassle of buying and managing servers. You pick the right compute option (EC2, containers, or serverless) for your needs, and AWS handles the rest!


# 🖥️ Introduction to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

## What is EC2?

- **EC2** is an AWS web service that provides secure, resizable virtual servers in the cloud.
- You get complete control over these virtual machines (called "instances").
- Pay only for what you use (per second or hour) and stop paying when you terminate the instance.

---

## Creating an EC2 Instance

To create an instance, you need to define:

1. **Hardware specifications:** CPU, memory, network, storage
2. **Logical configurations:** Network location, firewall rules, authentication, operating system

You can create and manage EC2 instances through:

- AWS Management Console (web interface)
- AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
- AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs)
- Automation tools

---

## 🍰 AMIs: The Recipe for Your EC2 Instance

An **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** is like a recipe or template for your server:

- Contains the operating system
- May include pre-installed software
- Defines storage mappings and architecture type (32-bit, 64-bit, ARM)

**Relationship Between AMI and EC2:**

- **AMI** = Recipe/blueprint/class
- **EC2 Instance** = Cake/built server/object

When you launch an instance, AWS:

1. Allocates a virtual machine on a hypervisor
2. Copies the AMI to the root device volume
3. Boots the volume
4. Gives you a server you can connect to

---

## Where to Find AMIs

| AMI Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Quick Start AMIs** | Pre-made by AWS for common use cases |
| **AWS Marketplace AMIs** | Third-party vendor software |
| **My AMIs** | Created from your own EC2 instances |
| **Community AMIs** | Provided by the AWS user community |
| **Custom Images** | Built with EC2 Image Builder |

Each AMI has an ID like "ami-1234abcd" that's unique to each AWS region.

---

## Choosing an Instance Type

Instance types determine hardware capabilities:

- **General Purpose (M-family):** Balanced resources (web servers, apps)
- **Compute Optimized (C-family):** More CPU power
- **Memory Optimized (R-family):** More RAM
- **Storage Optimized (D-family):** Fast local storage
- **Graphics Optimized (G-family):** GPU for graphics work

Each type comes in different sizes (nano to 24xlarge), affecting resources and cost.

                             +-------------------+

```

---

## AMI Reusability

One big advantage of AMIs is reusability:

1. Configure an EC2 instance with your web server and application
2. Create a new AMI from that configured instance
3. Launch new instances from this AMI—all with identical configuration
4. Save time and prevent human error when launching multiple servers

---

## Benefits of EC2

- **Flexibility:** Change instance types anytime as your needs change
- **Cost optimization:** Pay only for what you use
- **Speed:** Launch new servers in minutes
- **Experimentation:** Test different configurations quickly
- **Consistency:** Use AMIs for identical server environments
- **API-driven:** Automate everything through code

---

## 🚗 Real-World Example

Imagine you're opening a car rental business:

- **AMI** = The car model (sedan, SUV, truck)
- **Instance Type** = Features (basic, luxury, sport)
- **Instance Size** = Engine size (small, medium, large)
- **Running Instance** = The actual car you drive

**Reusable AMI Example:**

You customize a car perfectly for your business, then order 10 more exactly like it rather than customizing each one separately.

---

**In summary:**

EC2 gives you virtual servers in the cloud with complete control. Choose the right AMI and instance type for your needs, and create your own AMIs to easily replicate successful server configurations!



# 🔄 Amazon EC2 Instance Lifecycle: 

## What Makes Up an EC2 Instance?

An EC2 instance is a combination of:
- **vCPUs** (virtual processors)
- **Memory** (RAM)
- **Network** capacity
- **Storage** (sometimes local, sometimes external)
- **GPUs** (for graphics-intensive work, optional)

---

## Instance Types and Families

Instance types follow a naming pattern: **c5.large**
- **c5** = instance family and generation (5th generation compute-optimized)
- **large** = size/capacity

### Instance Family Types

| Family Type | Best For | Example Use Cases |
|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| **General Purpose** | Balanced resources | Web servers, small databases |
| **Compute Optimized** | CPU-heavy tasks | Scientific computing, gaming servers |
| **Memory Optimized** | RAM-intensive work | Large databases, analytics |
| **Accelerated Computing** | GPU/specialized hardware | 3D rendering, machine learning |
| **Storage Optimized** | High-speed storage | NoSQL databases, data warehousing |

## Instance State Actions

| Action | What Happens | IP Address | Data on Instance Store | Billing |
|--------|--------------|------------|----------------------|---------|
| **Reboot** | Restart OS on same server | Keeps same | Keeps data | Continues |
| **Stop/Start** | Move to new server | New public, same private | Loses data | Stops/resumes |
| **Terminate** | Permanently delete | Loses both | Loses data | Stops forever |
| **Stop-Hibernate** | Save RAM to disk | New public, same private | Saves RAM data | Stops |

---

## High Availability Best Practices

**Problem:** Single instance = single point of failure
**Solution:** Use multiple instances across different Availability Zones

````plaintext
+-------------------+         +-------------------+
|   AZ-1 (US-East)  |         |   AZ-2 (US-East)  |
|  +-------------+  |         |  +-------------+  |
|  | EC2 Instance|  |         |  | EC2 Instance|  |
|  +-------------+  |         |  +-------------+  |
+-------------------+         +-------------------+
````

**Better:** If one instance fails, the other keeps your app running!

## 💰 EC2 Pricing Options

### 1. On-Demand Instances
- **Pay as you go** (per second/hour)
- **No commitment**
- **Most expensive** but most flexible
- **Best for:** Unpredictable workloads, testing

### 2. Reserved Instances (RIs)
- **Commit for 1-3 years**
- **Big discounts** (up to 75% off)

## 🐱 Real-World Example

Imagine you're running a pizza delivery service:

- **On-Demand:** Rent delivery cars by the hour—expensive but flexible
- **Reserved:** Lease cars for 1-3 years—cheaper if you need them regularly
- **Spot:** Use surplus rental cars—cheapest, but they might take them back with short notice

---

**In summary:**  
EC2 instances go through different states (pending → running → stopped/terminated). Choose the right instance family for your workload, plan for high availability with multiple instances, and pick the pricing model that fits your usage pattern!

## ⏱️ Launch Process

1. **Instance State:** Pending → Running
2. **Status Checks:** Wait for both to pass
   - System status check
   - Instance status check
3. **Access:** Copy public IP address and open in browser

---

## 🐱 Real-World Example

Think of this like setting up a food truck:
1. **Choose the truck** (AMI = truck type)
2. **Pick engine size** (instance type = truck capabilities)
3. **Get permits** (security group = what traffic is allowed)
4. **Park in public spot** (public IP = customers can find you)
5. **Install equipment** (user data script = set up kitchen automatically)
6. **Open for business** (application running and accessible)

---

## 🎯 Current State

- **✅ What Works:** Application launches and displays empty employee directory
- **⏳ What's Missing:** 
  - S3 bucket (for storing employee photos)
  - DynamoDB table (for storing employee data)
  - Custom VPC (more secure networking)
  - High availability setup

---

**In summary:**  
Successfully launched an EC2 instance running the Employee Directory application! The app is accessible via public IP but shows empty data since the database and storage components haven't been set up yet. Next steps will include adding S3, DynamoDB, and custom networking.


Here's a clear, beginner-friendly summary of **Reading 2.3: Container Services on AWS** with diagrams, tables, and easy explanations:

---


# 📦 Container Services on AWS:

## What is a Container?

- A **container** is like a standardized shipping box for your application code.
- It packages your app and everything it needs to run (dependencies, libraries, etc.).
- Runs the same way everywhere—development, testing, production.

**Think of it like:** A food truck that has everything needed to serve food, can move anywhere and work the same way.

---

## Container vs Virtual Machine

| Feature | Container | Virtual Machine |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Operating System** | Shares host OS | Has its own OS |
| **Size** | Lightweight | Heavier |
| **Startup Time** | Almost instant | Takes minutes |
| **Resource Usage** | More efficient | Uses more resources |
| **Isolation** | Process-level | Full OS isolation |

## What is Docker?

- **Docker** is the most popular container platform.
- Makes it easy to create, package, and run containers.
- Like having a standardized way to build and ship your "application boxes."

---

## Container Orchestration on AWS

When you have many containers across multiple servers, you need **orchestration** to manage:
- Where to place containers
- What happens when containers fail
- How to scale up/down
- How to monitor everything

---

## AWS Container Services

### 1. Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)

- **AWS's own** container orchestration service
- **Fully managed** by AWS
- Runs on EC2 instances with ECS Agent installed

**Key Components:**
- **Container Instance:** EC2 with ECS Agent
- **Task Definition:** JSON blueprint describing your containers
- **Task:** Running instance of your task definition

**ECS Task Definition Example:**
````json
{
  "family": "webserver",
  "containerDefinitions": [{
    "name": "web",
    "image": "nginx",
    "memory": "100",
    "cpu": "99"
  }],
  "requiresCompatibilities": ["FARGATE"],
  "networkMode": "awsvpc",
  "memory": "512",
  "cpu": "256"
}
````

### 2. Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

- **Kubernetes-based** container orchestration
- Uses **open-source Kubernetes**
- Good if you already use Kubernetes elsewhere

**ECS vs EKS Terminology:**

| ECS | EKS |
|-----|-----|
| Container Instance | Worker Node |
| Task | Pod |
| AWS Native | Kubernetes-based |

## 🐱 Real-World Example

**Traditional Approach:**
You're opening multiple restaurants. Each needs its own building, kitchen, staff—expensive and slow to set up.

**Container Approach:**
You use food trucks (containers). Each truck has everything needed, can move anywhere, and you can quickly add more trucks during busy times.

**Orchestration:**
You need a dispatch center (ECS/EKS) to coordinate all your food trucks—where they go, when they open, what happens if one breaks down.

---

## When to Use Containers?

**Good for:**
- Microservices applications
- Development/testing environments
- Applications that need to scale quickly
- Moving apps between environments

**Consider VMs if:**
- You need full OS control
- Running legacy applications
- Need dedicated resources
- Security requires full isolation

---

**In summary:**  
Containers are lightweight, portable packages for your applications. AWS offers ECS (AWS-native) and EKS (Kubernetes-based) to help you manage containers at scale across multiple servers!

Here's a clear, beginner-friendly summary of **Serverless Computing on AWS** with diagrams, tables, and easy explanations:

# ⚡ Serverless Computing on AWS:

## The Management Spectrum

When choosing compute services, you're choosing between **control** and **convenience**.

### EC2/Container Management (More Control)

With EC2 and containers, **you manage:**
- Patching operating systems and software
- Scaling instances up/down
- High availability across multiple AZs
- Server maintenance and updates
- Monitoring and troubleshooting

**Benefit:** Complete control over your environment
**Drawback:** More operational overhead

### Serverless (More Convenience)

With serverless, **AWS manages:**
- All underlying infrastructure
- Scaling automatically
- High availability
- Server maintenance and patching
- Operating system updates

**Benefit:** Focus only on your application code
**Drawback:** Less control over the underlying system

---

- Monitoring        - Orchestration   - Patching      - Backups
- Networking        - Some Scaling    - Monitoring    - Updates
````

---

## What is Serverless?

- **Serverless** = You can't see or access the underlying servers
- AWS handles all the infrastructure management
- You only focus on your application code
- Pay only for what you use (no idle server costs)

**Important:** "Serverless" doesn't mean there are no servers—it means you don't manage them!

---

## Shared Responsibility Model Impact

| Service Type | Your Responsibilities | AWS Responsibilities |
|--------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **EC2** | OS patching, scaling, app code, data encryption | Hardware, hypervisor, network |
| **Serverless** | App code, data encryption, access management | Everything else (OS, scaling, patching, hardware) |

## 🐱 Real-World Example

**Traditional Approach (EC2):**
Like owning a restaurant—you control everything but must:
- Hire and manage all staff
- Maintain all equipment
- Handle busy/slow periods
- Fix problems when they occur

**Serverless Approach (Lambda):**
Like hiring a catering service—you provide the menu (code), they handle:
- Bringing the right number of chefs
- All equipment and setup
- Scaling for different event sizes
- Cleaning up afterwards

---

## When to Choose What?

### Choose EC2/Containers When:
- You need full control over the environment
- Running legacy applications
- Specific OS or software requirements

## How Fargate Works (4 Simple Steps)

### 1. Build & Store Container Images
- Create your container images
- Push them to **Amazon ECR** (Elastic Container Registry)
- ECR = AWS's container image storage service

### 2. Define Resources
- Specify how much **CPU** and **memory** your app needs
- Set **networking** and **storage** requirements
- No need to choose instance types!

### 3. Run Containers
- Deploy using ECS or EKS
- Fargate automatically provisions the infrastructure

### 4. Pay for Usage
- Pay only for **vCPU**, **memory**, and **storage** consumed
- No paying for idle servers

# ⚡ AWS Lambda: Serverless Computing:

## What is AWS Lambda?

- **AWS Lambda** is a serverless compute service that runs your code without managing servers.
- You upload your code as a **Lambda function**.
- Functions run only when **triggered**—not running 24/7 like EC2 instances.
- **Perfect for:** Quick processing tasks, event-driven applications, microservices.

---

## How Lambda Works

1. **Upload your code** to create a Lambda function
2. **Configure a trigger** (what starts your function)
3. **AWS waits** for the trigger event
4. **When triggered,** AWS runs your code automatically
5. **Function scales** from 1 to 1,000+ concurrent executions
6. **Pay only** for actual execution time (rounded to nearest millisecond)

---

## 🖼️ Lambda Trigger Examples

# 🎮 Choose the Right AWS Compute Service (Game Show Edition!)

## The Game Show Format

Welcome to "Which AWS Compute Service Should I Choose?" - Let's play through three real-world scenarios!

---

## 🎯 Scenario 1: Quarterly Inventory Upload

**The Challenge:**
- Online store needs to update inventory database
- Currently done manually (slow, error-prone)
- Goal: Upload spreadsheet to S3 → automatically update database
- **Frequency:** Only once per quarter

**Options:**
- **EC2:** Could work, but runs 24/7 for quarterly task = expensive
- **Lambda:** Perfect! Only runs when triggered, pay per use

**✅ Winner: AWS Lambda**

**Why Lambda Wins:**
- **Cost-effective:** Only pay when code runs
- **Event-driven:** S3 upload triggers Lambda function
- **Perfect fit:** Infrequent, short-duration tasks

````plaintext
+-------------------+         +-------------------+         +-------------------+
|  Upload to S3     |  ---->  |  Lambda Triggered |  ---->  |  Database Updated |

- **Familiar:** Works like traditional servers

---

## 🎯 Scenario 3: New Microservices Application

**The Challenge:**
- Building brand-new microservices architecture
- Need quick scaling up/down
- Want to reduce deployment risk

**Analysis:**
- **EC2:** Slower boot times, heavier infrastructure ❌
- **Lambda:** Good for some microservices, but limited runtime ⚠️
- **Containers (ECS/EKS):** Perfect for microservices! ✅

**✅ Winner: Amazon ECS or EKS**

**Why Containers Win:**
- **Fast scaling:** Containers start almost instantly
- **Consistency:** Same container runs everywhere (dev → test → prod)
- **Microservices-friendly:** Natural fit for service-oriented design
- **Lower deployment risk:** "Works on my machine" → "Works everywhere"

**In summary:**
Choose your compute service based on your specific needs: EC2 for control and migrations, Lambda for events and cost efficiency, and Containers for modern microservices architecture. The right choice depends on your use case, not just what's newest or coolest!


 # 📖 Reading 2.4: Serverless and AWS Lambda

## 🎯 Overview
This guide covers serverless computing concepts and AWS Lambda, focusing on removing undifferentiated heavy lifting and letting developers focus on application logic rather than infrastructure management.

---

## 🏗️ Removing the Undifferentiated Heavy Lifting

### Traditional Responsibility Model

| Service | AWS Manages | You Manage |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Amazon EC2** 🖥️ | Physical hardware | Guest OS, Security, Patching, Networking, Scaling |
| **Amazon ECS/EKS** 🐳 | Container management, Cluster deployment | Underlying EC2 instances |
| **Serverless** ☁️ | Everything infrastructure-related | Just your application code |

### Real-Life Example 🏠
Think of it like housing options:
- **EC2**: Buying a house - you own everything but maintain everything
- **ECS/EKS**: Renting an apartment - some maintenance included, but you handle utilities
- **Serverless**: Hotel stay - just bring your luggage (code), everything else is handled

---

## 🚀 Go Serverless: Four Key Aspects

### ✨ Core Principles

| Aspect | Description | Real-Life Analogy |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| 🚫 **No Server Management** | No provisioning or managing servers | Like using Uber instead of owning a car |
| 📈 **Auto-Scaling** | Scales automatically with usage | Restaurant that adjusts staff based on customers |
| 💰 **Pay-per-Use** | Never pay for idle resources | Electric bill - pay only for what you use |
| 🛡️ **Built-in Reliability** | Availability and fault tolerance included | Emergency services - always available |
