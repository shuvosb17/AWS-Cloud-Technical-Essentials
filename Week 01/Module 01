# Introduction to AWS: Key Concepts

## 1. What is AWS and Cloud Computing?

**AWS (Amazon Web Services)** is a platform that provides cloud computing services.  
**Cloud computing** means using remote servers on the internet to store, manage, and process data, instead of using your own computer or local servers.

### Why Use the Cloud?
- **Scalability:** Easily increase or decrease resources as needed.
- **Cost-effective:** Pay only for what you use.
- **Reliability:** High availability and fault tolerance.
- **Security:** Built-in security features.

## 2. AWS Global Infrastructure

AWS is made up of **Regions** and **Availability Zones**.

+-------------------+         +-------------------+
|    Region 1       |         |    Region 2       |
|  (e.g., US-East)  |         |  (e.g., EU-West)  |
|  +-------------+  |         |  +-------------+  |
|  | AZ1         |  |         |  | AZ1         |  |
|  | AZ2         |  |         |  | AZ2         |  |
|  +-------------+  |         |  +-------------+  |
+-------------------+         +-------------------+
````

- **Region:** A geographic area (like US-East, EU-West).
- **Availability Zone (AZ):** A data center within a region. Each region has multiple AZs for redundancy.

## 3. Building an App on AWS

You’ll build an **Employee Directory App** (CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete).

### Main AWS Services Used

+-------------------+
|  User's Browser   |
+--------+----------+
         |
         v
+-------------------+
|   Load Balancer   |  <-- Distributes traffic
+--------+----------+
         |
         v
+-------------------+
|      EC2          |  <-- Virtual servers (backend code)
+--------+----------+
         |
         v
+-------------------+
|      RDS          |  <-- Database (employee data)
+-------------------+

+-------------------+
|       S3          |  <-- Stores images/files
+-------------------+

+-------------------+
|      IAM          |  <-- Security & access control
+-------------------+

+-------------------+
|   CloudWatch      |  <-- Monitoring
+-------------------+
````

### How the App Works
- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):** Your own private network in AWS.
- **EC2:** Runs your app’s backend code.
- **RDS:** Stores employee data in a database.
- **S3:** Stores employee photos and other files.
- **Elastic Load Balancer:** Distributes incoming traffic to multiple EC2 instances.
- **Auto Scaling:** Automatically adds/removes EC2 instances based on demand.
- **IAM:** Manages who can access what in AWS.
- **CloudWatch:** Monitors your app’s health and performance.

## 4. Security Basics

- **IAM (Identity and Access Management):** Controls who can do what in your AWS account.
- **Start Secure:** Set up security from the beginning.

---

## 5. Learning Approach

- **Theory:** Understand the concepts.
- **Technical Knowledge:** Learn how to use AWS services.
- **Vocabulary:** Get familiar with AWS terms.
- **Practice:** Build and experiment with real AWS resources.

## 6. Fun Extras

- **Meowzy and Fluffy:** Mascots that give you tips and best practices during the course.
